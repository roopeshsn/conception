# Create Linux Command Helper

## A command helper api to search linux commands

Create an app to search linux commands to help users install and learn about their usage.

App should be cross-platform to reach various device users.

App should also give alternative commands to install a single package and should also describe which command to choose in which case.

App should suggest only 2 alternatives to single command to avoid unnecessary confusion.

App search results should have preference from most commands to least used.
